    work: "I developed a full-stack web application using Azure functions, Next.js, and Redux to drive down costs in cloud infrastructure by 72% through recommendations with actionable buttons that changed infrastructure on the cloud real-time using the Azure API. I also developed a counter app using Terraform to provision an EC2 instance, API Gateway, Lambda function, IAM rules, and CloudWatch logs in the cloud. Then, this was connected with GCP's BigQuery and wrapped in a Dockerized self-hosted runner for Github Actions. This demonstrated cloud hybrid solutions for implementing full stack web applications using a CI/CD pipeline. I also presented on API Gateway equivalents across major cloud providers listing cost, feature, and use-case differences to 80+ employees in the Cloud division.",
